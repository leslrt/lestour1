          <h2>Love letter para kay April <3</h2>
          <p>Hii Gorgeous,</p>
          <p>
            Happy Valentines day!! i hope this message finds you in good
            spirits, because you've been on my mind like all these time. i know
            this isn't the most grand or extravagant declaration of love, but i
            rly wan't to show my love for u kahit wala kaming valentines jk
            HAHAHAAHAH, anw i'm broke atm so all can do is spend sleepless
            nights making this huhu sana 'wag ka ma-disappoint, i can always do
            better always remember that. i will make bawi once i'm financially
            stable na ulit, and uhh 'yon enough drama baka ma cringe ka na
            HASJDGAHSGDJHAG.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, this might sound a bit clich√©, but i just had to let you know
            how much you mean to me, even if it's through this low-key online
            letter. every moment spent with you is like finding a hidden gem in
            a sea of ordinary rocks. you bring color to my world, sunshine to my
            cloudy days, and spark to my life. seriously, you're like the
            ultimate power-up that levels up my whole existence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pls be in good health always, take care of yourself ha, iloveyou!!
            don't be hard on urself rin. 'yon lang hehe miss u na, looking
            forward na maka-bond kana ulii, my honeybunch.<3
          </p>
          <p>Sincerely,<br />les<3</p>
